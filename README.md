# edX Learning Objective Visual Analytics Workflow
The edX Learning Objective Visual Analytics R Scripts is a processing pipeline used to analyze edX course and student level data in the context of learing objectives identified by instructional designer. The scripts leverage edX Data Package data sets and a learning objective analysis matrix. 

## Protocol
A generalize protocol is available at Protocols.io, [edX Learning Objective Visual Analytics Workflow, V.1](), [dx.doi.org/....](). The protocol covers how to use data processing, analysis and visualizations scripts in the workflow. 

## Sample Data


## A Note on Using the edX Learning Objective Visual Analytics Workflow R Scripts
The processing scripts are provided under Apache License 2.0. Contributors provide permission for commercial use, modification, distribution, patent use, and private use.

This workflow relies initially processing course data using data processing protocol available at Protocols.io

The protocol is further described in the publication:

Additional modifications are likely needed to make use of these workflows when processing your course datasets that use the edX Data Package format specification. Organizational implementation of the edX learning management systems may use customized event log tracking systems, courses may use different types of edX block modules, and logs may include types of events that were not encountered in this project (e.g. error events, or edX discussion forums). An exploratory analysis of the course structure and event logs is advisable at the outset of a project.
